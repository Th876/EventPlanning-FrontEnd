</p>

<p>PlaniVerse is the third project I created at <a href="https://perscholas.org/courses/software-engineer/software-engineer-atlanta/">Per Scholas'</a> Software Engineer Training program using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack">MERN</a>stack. It is an event planning app in which the user, i.e. an event planner, is able to do all four <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/basics/crud">CRUD</a> operations. The <a href="https://github.com/Th876/EventPlanning-FrontEnd">frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Th876/EventPlanning-BackEnd">backend</a> are created in two separate GitHub repositories. More specifically, an event planner is able to create, display, update, and delete an event. This is the <a href="https://event-planning-frontend.onrender.com/">live link</a> for my MERN Application.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>This is the <a href="https://event-planning-frontend.onrender.com/">live link</a></p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/Th876/EventPlanning-BackEnd">backend repository link</a></p>

<hr></hr>
<h4>Future Enhancements</h4>
<p>In the future, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Add a feature where the event planner is able to edit each event card’s image to reflect the type of event.</li>
<li> Incorporate a mood board so that the event planner can have multiple images for inspiration. The event planner would be able to retrieve images from their personal computer or the internet.</li>
<li>User authentication so that the event planner’s information is secure </li>
<li>A live chat feature in which the event planner can communicate directly with clients.</li>

<h4>How to Setup</h4>



<h3>Planning Process</h3>
<p>Google docs was used to jot down ideas for this project. My wireframe was designed via Figma. The website's colors were sourced on Coolors; and animations were created via Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and some were sourced on Freepik.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing an API that works, and does not require credit card payment</li>
<li>Linking images to display in the browser via the map method</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started with Create React App</h3>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
